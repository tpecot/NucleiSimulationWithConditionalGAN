# NucleiSimulationWithConditionalGAN
Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (pix2pix) to realistically simulate images showing nuclei.

These Jupyter notebooks allow to simulate fluorescence images showing nuclei (or other biological objects) from images with masks with the conditional generative adversarial network called pix2pix. Images with nuclei masks can be generated by drawing ellipses with number and size defined from distributions estimated from the real images.
